http://gvmtool.net/[GVM - the Groovy enVironment Manager] is a great tool for managing multiple versions of Groovy, Grails, Gradle, ...
If you want to use Groovy, vert.x and Gradle on Beaglebone like me, you have to check/install GVM dependencies.

Generally, Debian distrib. is used with Beaglebone and Raspberry Pi.
GVM is a bash tool and depends only on curl and unzip.
Unfortunately, unzip is not installed by default. You may have an error while running GVM.
You'll have to install these dependencies with a command like

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt-get install curl unzip
----

You can now install GVM easily

[source,bash]
----
curl -s get.gvmtool.net | bash
----

Then latest version of Groovy, Gradle and vert.x can be installed

[source,bash]
----
gvm install groovy
gvm install vertx
gvm install gradle
----
